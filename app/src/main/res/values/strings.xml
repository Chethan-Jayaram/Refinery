    <string name="about_app"> An About Us page helps your company make a good first impression, and is critical for building customer
                trust and loyalty. An About Us page should make sure to cover basic information about the store and its
                founders, explain the company\'s purpose and how it differs from the competition, and encourage
                discussion and interaction. Here are some free templates, samples, and example About Us pages to help your ecommerce store stand out from the crowd.\n\n
                When it comes to personalizing your online store, nothing is more effective than an About Us page. This
                is a quick summary of your company\'s history and purpose, and should provide a clear overview of the
                company\'s brand story. A great About Us page can help tell your brand story, establish customer loyalty,
                and turn your bland ecommerce store into an well-loved brand icon. Most importantly, it will give your
                customers a reason to shop from your brand.\n\n  In this post, we\'ll give you three different ways to create a professional about us page for your online
                store, blog, or other website - use our about us page generator, use the fill-in-the-blank about us
                template below, or create your own custom page using the about us examples within this article.</string>

    <string name="aboutHotel">
    Located two blocks from Bryant Park, Refinery Hotel is a luxury hotel in Midtown Manhattan’s Garment District. While our home in the 1912 Colony Arcade building gives us a long history, our stylish loft rooms, acclaimed Parker &amp; Quinn restaurant, and trendsetting Refinery Rooftop bar create a fashionable refuge for locals and cultured visitors in present-day New York. \n \n

    Drawing inspiration from our early life as a hat factory, each of the 197 rooms at Refinery Hotel feature industrial details such as 12-foot ceilings, large windows, and distressed hardwood floors. With mosaic tile floors and copper accents, our marble bathrooms are luxurious, down to the exclusive Le Labo bath products. 42" LCD TVs, fully-stocked minibars, and complimentary free WiFi access are also included in every room. \n

    The Refinery Hotel is ADA compliant in accordance with the construction statutes of the Department of Justice 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design. For information about accessible features, please view our Accessibility Statement.\n

    Refinery Hotel continues the Colony Arcade’s long tradition as a midtown meeting place. Home to a bar and restaurant since 1914, Refinery Hotel serves ribeye and soft-shell crabs at our Parker &amp; Quinn restaurant, while our intimate lobby bar, Winnie’s, hosts a schedule of live jazz music. Our celebrated, year-round Refinery Rooftop bar is known for its innovative cocktails created by In Good Company mixologists, as well as its unparalleled Empire State Building views. And from wine hours to pop-up programming in our Hatbox flex space, there is always something to see and do at the hotel.\n \n

    Centrally located in Midtown Manhattan, Refinery Hotel is within walking distance of legendary shopping on Fifth Avenue. Our concierge is available to suggest shopping, dining and entertainment recommendations suited to specific needs and tastes, while our carefully crafted destination guide highlights our favorite things to see and do nearby—whether it’s taking in a new exhibit at one of the city’s finest museums uptown or exploring the downtown cocktail scene.\n \n
